## Markdown Online Editors

**Bangle.io**
(web: [`app.bangle.io`](https://app.bangle.io/), open source @ github [`bangle-io/bangle-io`](https://github.com/bangle-io/bangle-io)) -
A simple yet powerful Markdown-based note-taking app with WYSIWYG editing and local-first storage.


**markupmarkdown**
(web: [`mumd.metavert.io`](https://mumd.metavert.io), open source @ github [`jonradoff/markupmarkdown`](https://github.com/jonradoff/markupmarkdown)) -
"Google Docs for Markdown" — collaborative editor and review tool for Markdown files: anchored comment threads on any text selection, suggested changes with one-click apply, review states (approve / request changes), document checks, and GitHub round-trip (open any repo's `.md`, edit, push back as a PR). Includes an MCP server so AI agents can comment, suggest, and review through the same loop as humans. MIT licensed, built with Go + React.


**MDXG Redline**
(web: [`mkdn.review`](https://mkdn.review/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Foubakiou%2Fmdxg-redline%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmain%2FREADME.md), open source @ github [`oubakiou/mdxg-redline`](https://github.com/oubakiou/mdxg-redline)) -
Read-only Markdown (pre)viewer with inline review comments, distributed as a single standalone HTML file (also runnable via `npx mdxg-redline`). Implements the MDXG Viewer profile: Word/Pages-style stacked virtual pages, page navigation and outline, in-document search, and left-hand WASD keyboard navigation. Renders Shiki syntax highlighting (~235 languages), Mermaid diagrams, KaTeX math, and GitHub Flavored Markdown footnotes, with smartphone support. Select any text range to leave a comment; comments export as structured JSON keyed by headingPath and sourceLine, so an LLM agent can apply each one back to the exact lines. The standalone/CLI build makes no network requests (CSP connect-src 'none'); an optional online edition at mkdn.review fetches Markdown from an allowlisted public raw URL via a `?url=` parameter. MIT licensed.
